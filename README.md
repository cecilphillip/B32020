! ***This is not a serious application.*** !

After you dig through this code, you might realize that it's definitely way too involved what it does. Well... that's the point 🙃.
Almost every new feature of C# 8 and .NET Core 3.x was in here in just for the fun of it. It's an interesting learning experience once you figure out how this mess works.

Have fun digging through the code and seeing what it does!

## Running the code
The only thing you'll need for this is .NET Core SDK 3.1. Maybe you might want to grab a copy of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cephilli) or [Visual Studi0](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cephilli).

After you've cloned the repo, run the following command in your terminal.
  
```shell
> dotnet run
```
